                <p>The beginning of my trip started in Scottsdale, Arizona which is where my sister lives.
                    At the time, she had been living there for 12 years and spent her summers in Bend, Oregon which was the reason for our roadtrip. 
                    When I arrived in Scottsdale, we hiked Camelbak Mountain. In the days to follow, we played golf at a number of golf courses and on the third day,
                    we departed for our first destination.

                    <p>Our first stop on our roadtrip was LA. We stayed at a hotel right on Santa Montica Beach for two nights.
                        On our first day, we hiked to the Hollywood sign and had dinner in Beverly Hills. The next day we went on a 30 mile bikeride down the strip along the beach.
                        For dinner, we went to the home of the supposed best burger in LA.

                <p>On our way out of LA, we stopped in Malibu for brunch at a restaurant called Geoffrey's with one of the must beautiful views of the ocean I have ever seen.
                    I definitely plan to go back there.

                    <p>Our next stop on our road trip was Santa Barbara. We only stayed here for a night but it was beautiful. Santa Barbara is known 
                        for the number of celebreties who have vacation homes there. We had a cocktail at the Four Seasons which is where Kim Kardashian had her honeymoon 
                        before she got a divorce 72 days later.

                    <p>After Santa Barbara, we drove to San Francisco. We were only there for about 24 hours but we managed to pack so much in that short amount of time, it felt like we were there for about 3 days.
                        We visited the famous Fisherman's Wharf, walked around to site-see, had lunch and drank some beers at The Palace of Fine Arts, and later had dinner with some friends who lived in the city.

                    <p>Before heading to my sister's summer house in Bend, we decided to stop in Eugene to visit the University of Oregon. As a competitor of track and field and more specifically a distance runner,
                        The University of Oregon is sort of a historical landmark for the sport. In fact, it is often reffered to as "Tracktown, USA." We visited the campus, I did a workout on the Historical Hayward Field (before I was kicked out), and
                        went to VooDoo Donuts.

                    <img height="300px" width="400px" src="photos/bend.jpg" alt="Kayaker in Bend, Oregon">
                    <p>After 5 days of travelling which included almost 24 hours of driving, we made it to Bend where I stayed for 3 days. We went on a 30 mile bikeride through the mountains, I experienced my frist CrossFit workout, we kayaked down and back up the Deschutes River, and tried a variety of foods.
                        At one point, my sister drove me only 20 minutes towards the mountains and we found snow in JUNE. Bend reminds me a lot of Saint Charles, Missouri (which is where I'm from) except it has mountains. Making it much prettier. 
                        It's a really great city.

                    <img height="300px" width="400px" src="photos/portland.jpg" alt="Portland, Oregon">
                    <p>After a few days in Bend, it was time for me to fly back home to Missouri. Since I would be departing from the Portland airport, we made a daytrip out of it
                        and I got to explore the city a litle bit. I wish I could have spent more time there.
